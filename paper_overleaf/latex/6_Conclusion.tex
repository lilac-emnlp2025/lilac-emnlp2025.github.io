We presented \texttt{LILaC}, a multimodal retrieval framework designed to address the limitations of existing methods by incorporating layered component graph and late-interaction-based subgraph retrieval.
Our layered graph construction explicitly captures semantic relationships among multimodal components, facilitating effective multihop reasoning. 
The late-interaction retrieval method dynamically evaluates fine-grained component relevance, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy, yet efficient.
\updated{\texttt{LILaC}'s usage of pretrained multimodal encoders allows it to inherit the improvements from newer off-the-shelf embeddings.
Extensive experiments confirm that \texttt{LILaC} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all five benchmarks, also demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness in open-domain multimodal retrieval.}
